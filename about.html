Since then, my love of baking has grown and matured.  As a hobby, I began decorating cakes a few years ago, after watching a birthday cake themed Food Network Challenge.  While I am far from a professional, I enjoy supplying the cakes for most of our family birthdays and holidays.  In addition to cakes and cookies, I am always looking for new dessert ideas.</p>

<h2>Learning to cook…</h2>
<p>My love for cooking didn’t start at an early age the way my love for baking did.  In fact, I was lucky to pass my Home Economics class in high school because my omelets looked like soupy scrambled eggs, and I somehow managed to burn an entire batch of fettuccine noodles.  However, once I got to college, cooking became a necessity. I began to learn a few simple recipes so that I could cook for myself and my roommates to avoid eating in the cafeteria.  It wasn’t until I got married and started my career that I really began to enjoy cooking.  Cooking became my way to unwind and relax after a long day at work.  The more I cooked for my husband and myself, the more I wanted to learn.</p>

<h2>My Kitchen Addition…</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few years to the present.  After working in the IT industry for a while, and then working part-time as a consultant, I decided it was time for a break. Now, I am focusing my efforts in the kitchen and working as a freelance writer and photographer.  I feel blessed to be able to spend so much time in the kitchen cooking and baking for my family and friends.  I love experimenting with new recipes and learning new techniques.  My Kitchen Addiction is a collection of my thoughts and ideas related to all things food.  Enjoy!</p> </div>
